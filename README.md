# vip-templates
Objective-C variation of VIP architecture
http://clean-swift.com/clean-swift-ios-architecture/
Contains XCode file templates and example project.

#Known issues:
File template contains folders. When created from template folders are added as references not as groups. So you need to manually re add it to project after creation.

#TODO:
finish example project
create tests for example project
create "generamba" template: https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/Generamba
create Swift template
create Swift project example
